    <h1><b>The metacloud terms of use</b></h1>

    <p><b><i>Last updated on February 24, 2022</i></b></p>

    <p>These Metacloud Terms of Use (the “Terms”) set forth the terms and conditions under which Metacloud Incorporated, a company incorporated in UAE, including its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, “MC”, “us”, “our”, or “we”), and you (“you” or “your”) agree to be governed as it relates to any of your activity in Metacloud, a decentralized, community-driven platform created and owned by MC (“Metacloud”). These Terms govern your access to, use of, and interaction with Metacloud, including any content, functionality, and services offered on or through Metacloud and your creation of any Assets and/or Games (defined below) (collectively, the “Services”).</p>
    <p>Please read these Terms carefully before you start to use Metacloud. By using Metacloud, you accept and agree to be bound and abide by these Terms and our Privacy Policy, which can be found at the following URL: Privacy Policy, you must not access or use Metacloud.</p>
    <p>Metacloud is offered and available to users who are 18 years of age or older. By accessing or using Metacloud, you represent and warrant that you are of legal age to form a binding contract with MC and meet the foregoing eligibility requirements. If you do not meet all of these requirements, you must not access or use Metacloud.</p>

    <h2>Metacloud</h2>
    <p>Metacloud enables users such as you to create, buy, transfer, and trade unique digital game assets in voxel art (each, an “Asset” and together, the “Assets”), which can then be used on metacloud for game-making purposes. Metacloud further enables users such as you to purchase and publish onto LANDs parcels in metacloud within which you can create Assets and visual scripting using metacloud Game Maker, which creates an interactive experience built for, and published on, metacloud (each, a “Game”). A Game may be made available to users of metacloud and you will control the pricing and business model (free, free-2-play or premium) of the Game.</p>
    <p>By utilizing our Services, you affirm that you are aware and acknowledge that MC is a non-custodial provider of software services that has developed and distributed metacloud where the Services occur without any involvement or actions taken by MC or any third-party.</p>

    <h2>ASSET & GAME CREATION</h2>
    <p>You may create, upload, and exchange Assets and create Games that comply with these Terms, including the following requirements:</p>
    <p>Assets are created in VoxEdit. Games are created with metacloud Game Maker.</p>
    <p>Assets and Games must comply with the Metadata Specifications (defined and included below).</p>
    <p>Assets must be unique. Any Assets that exhibit obvious visual similarities to a pre-existing Asset will be removed from metacloud. MC retains the right to moderate and review Assets for copyright infringement and to remove Assets from metacloud that violate these Terms.</p>
    <p>Assets and Games must not be pornographic, threatening, harassing, libelous, hate-oriented, harmful, defamatory, racist, xenophobic, or illegal, as will be determined by MC in its sole discretion.</p>
    <p>To reiterate, each new Asset must be different enough from all existing Assets. If variations are not allowed, which is the default, no Asset should look like, or be similar to, another Asset even if they differ in size and/or color. New Assets being sufficiently different from existing Assets will be determined in the sole discretion of MC.</p>
    <p>By uploading an Asset to metacloud, you agree never to publish the Asset elsewhere. <br> You are solely responsible for ensuring that any Assets you submit to the Services comply with any applicable laws and third party rights, including but not limited to any intellectual property rights, privacy rights and publicity rights.</p>
    <p>You agree that any information included in your Assets and/or Games may be used in accordance with our Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p>MC always has the right, in its sole discretion, to accept or reject any Assets and/or Games.</p>

    <h2>LANDS</h2>
    <p>You may purchase Lands within metacloud. Within your Land, you may edit your Metadata to adjust title, description, URL link, preview image, and logo. All Metadata (and any URL, images, or logos to which it links or that are uploaded) must comply with these Terms and specifically cannot link to or contain any material or content that is pornographic, threatening, harassing, libelous, hate-oriented, harmful, defamatory, racist, xenophobic, or illegal. We reserve the right to moderate and/or delete any Metadata that does not comply with these Terms.</p>

    <h2>SALE OF ASSETS AND GAMES; PAYMENT</h2>
    <p>You may make your Asset eligible to be sold in metacloud marketplace. You and MC shall mutually agree on the price for the Asset in metacloud marketplace. You will control the scarcity of the Asset in metacloud marketplace. Any revenue earned in metacloud marketplace for sales of the Asset, minus any transaction fees, shall be paid to you immediately on the blockchain by the purchaser of your Asset. A Game may be made available for sale to users of metacloud and you will control the pricing and business model (free, free-2-play or premium) of the Game. Any revenue earned in metacloud marketplace for sales of a Game, minus any transaction fees, shall be paid to you immediately on the blockchain by the purchaser of your Game.</p>
    <p>If you elect to purchase and/or sell Assets and/or Games on metacloud, any financial transactions that you engage in will be conducted solely through the Ethereum network via MetaMask (or other Ethereum-compatible wallets and browsers). MC has no insight into or control over these payments or transactions, nor do we have the ability to reverse any transactions. With that in mind, MC will have no liability to you or to any third party for any claims or damages that may arise as a result of any transactions that you engage in on metacloud.</p>
    <p>Each sales transaction that occurs in metacloud will be subject to a fee payable by the purchaser to MC. Such fee will be automatically applied as part of the sales transaction.</p>

End users who purchase the Asset own that underlying, purchased NFT completely and have the right to sell, trade, donate, give away, transfer, or otherwise dispose of the NFT as they see fit; provided, however, that each Asset will be tokenized so that it will have provable scarcity and proof of ownership.</p>

    <p>If you purchase an Asset in metacloud, please be aware that the creator of the Asset retains copyright to the Asset, which means you cannot use the Asset for commercial purposes of any kind; provided, however, that you do acquire the right to display and resell the Asset.</p>
